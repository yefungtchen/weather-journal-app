# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Project
1) Set up the project environment and installed Node and all needed packages which need to be included in the server.js file.
2) Then added POST and GET routes to make sure that the data is received from the server.
3) Made API credentials on OpenWeatherMap
4) In the next step I created async functions to fetch all the weather data from OWM and store it into my local server.
5) Set up a click-event to update the UI dynamically.
